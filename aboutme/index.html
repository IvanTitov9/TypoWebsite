<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I love travelling. I have had the pleasure of traveling to many different countries and cities whether it be with my parents, friends or on my own. This year is no exception, over the easter period I have been invited to Hong Kong to watch the last sevens tournament at the old stadium.  Over the summer I plan to drive through Italy, heading up to Spain and finishing the two-week road trip in Madrid. </p>
<p>I have visited stunning countries including Vietnam, Madagascar and Bali where I met the friendliest people and learned new things about the fascinating cultures there however, there has always been a country on my bucket list where I haven’t been able to travel for over 3 years. That country is New Zealand. It has been a plan for so long now and every time something goes wrong, maybe this is a sign that I shouldn’t go there because something bad will happen, I think it’s a lot more likely that I would just end up living there.</p>

<p>I find traveling intriguing because it widens your knowledge and ability to communicate with others. It teaches you more than any school could as it teaches you about life.</p>

<p>I have always been very sporty throughout my life and sport has always been a big part of my life. From a young age I participated in many athletics events usually winning the high jump despite being one of the shortest. After the age of 7 football started to take on a very prominent position in my life and I would go on to play for a football club in Russia until a series of injuries provoked me to stop playing football professionally, I still however, carried on playing for my college first team despite being 2 years below the average age. 
</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 2018 when I needed surgery on my ankle, that my footballing career ended abruptly. Since 2018 I have had three surgeries on my left ankle which have allowed me to walk again but not much else. Skipping forward to 2021 and I am not able to go to the gym on a regular basis and at least keep myself healthy on the bike machines. 
</p>
<p>I do miss playing sport, but I am happy to still be in very close contact with it as many of my friends play upwards of semi-pro level in sports ranging from football to cricket. 
</p>
<p>
  I grew up in Russia and moved to the UK at the age of 7. I went straight to boarding school and was meant to be in BBC's 'Britans youngest Boarders' however, I couldn't speak any English and couldn't participate. Since then I have lived in the UK for over 12 years.
