Luxury brands are made for the small percentage of people who wear then, so let’s have a look at the companies where we would usually buy our clothes.

Nike, Adidas and Topman all have the tendency to use less space for their name and more general space left just like it is with the expensive companies then what makes us initially think that they are affordable?

All more affordable companies tend to use more bold colours, for instance, Nike uses Black. H&M use red, the colours used by affordable companies seem to be bolder but there is a reason for it. By using these bold colours, the company invites people as it is seen as exiting but also, it gives off the impression of reliability, comfort and it feels like a place you have been to before. Colours of course play a big role in the appearance of the logo and the appearance of the brand, but nothing beats the font. The font becomes the most important aspect once again.

Topman, H&M and Boohoo to name a few, all have a similar approach to the typography on their logos. Despite some like H&M opting for colourful red letters, most are simple. They don’t use serifs; they are structured and don’t feel luxurious. Once again, our brain takes just a few seconds to analyse that and give us the information whereas people would have been working for months and months on the logo. This does not only include well known brands. Even a brand that has only just started or is in the process of being made their will be without a doubt a team who will be carefully making the logo so that the company is demonstrated in the correct light. These aspects make up the logo and it is vital for the companies to get them right.

Over the course of the 2 weeks, we have been able to have a quick glimpse at the numerous clothing brands that exist and depict the main aspects of their logos that portray exactly what the company is about. We have understood that logos of luxury brands of clothing don’t differ too much from the style that the cheaper brands go for as well. We have learnt that colour also plays an important role but not anywhere near as much as the most important participator, typography!
