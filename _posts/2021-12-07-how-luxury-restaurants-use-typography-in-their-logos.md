It is uncommon to categorise restaurants in the same bracket as shops and jewellery however, a successful restaurant is also a successful business just like Luis Vuitton or Cartier.

Some of the most well-known restaurants across the world all have very high business capabilities. Of course, one of those restaurants would be Hells Kitchen. At the helm of this business is of course, Gordon Ramsey. After being brought up in Scotland and playing football, he became a chef, but not only a chef, also a huge media personality. Because of his eccentric personality he has managed to build an empire whilst also gaining over 20 Michelin stars for his numerous restaurants. Other restaurants have also fallen under The Gordon Ramsey category, one of the most famous Instagram chefs ‘Salt Bae’ or Nusret Gökçe has acquired a following of over 40 million on Instagram and has since opened restaurants in Dubai and in London with dinners costing upwards of 10 thousand dollars. There are numerous chefs around the world who have a strong social media presence and this in term help them build their brand.

Another carefully monitored aspect of their business is the branding. This of course includes their public image and the commercial side of their restaurants but one aspect which is rarely spoken about just like with Luxury Clothing and Luxury Jewellery is the Typography in their Logos
